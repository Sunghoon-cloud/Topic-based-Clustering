## Let's import the preprocessed data for the restaurant with the largest reviews

Bianco_data<-read.csv("data_Bianco.csv",head=TRUE)

#X0<- word frequency matrix divided by total number of reviews
# Y<- star ratings of each restaurant

Y<- Bianco_data$stars
X0<-Bianco_data[,10:242]
X<-as.matrix(cbind(1,X0)) # you should add intercept by using this code.

## Please download the following two R packages and import them  

source("Package_Topic-based_Segmentation.R") ## R package for topic-based Segmentation model : Latent class regression with Group variable selection
source("Package_Dendrogram_Dimensions.R")


Opt_Hyper<-(list("sp1"=1,"sp2"=1,"r1"=1,"r2"=0.01, "J" = 0.01, "cutoff"=0.5)) ## default setting, you can change the setting for hyperparameters.

# without Opt_Hyper, the default setting for tuning parameters are: "sp1=1; sp2=1; r1=1; r2=0.01; J = 0.01; cutoff=0.3"

topic_result<-Topic_Bayes_Mixture(Y,X,K=3,T0=2000,T=3000,Opt_Hyper)
