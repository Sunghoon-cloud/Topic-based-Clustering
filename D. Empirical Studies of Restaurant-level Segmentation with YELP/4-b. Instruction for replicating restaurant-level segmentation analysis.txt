### After downloading the original Yelp data from the link, please run the preprocessing code of "IV. Preprocessing raw Yelp reviews_Restaruant Segmentation" in this repository
## Note, restaurant-level analysis takes some hours due to data size, but customer-level analysis takes relatively small time. 


# Let's import the preprocessed data
Restaurant<-read.csv("restaurant_yelp.csv", head=TRUE)

# X0<- word frequency matrix divided by total number of reviews as indepenent variables (IV) matrix
# Y<- Restaurant$star_ratings of each restaurant as dependent variable matrix

X<-as.matrix(cbind(1,X0)) # you should add intercept for your IVs.
